# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a front-end developer. Here's a quick guide to help you navigate and understand the features of this website.

## Getting Started
To view the website, simply open the **`index.html`** file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

## Features

### Navigation Menu

At the top of the page, you'll find a navigation menu that allows you to quickly jump to different sections of the website:

- **About:** Learn more about me.
- **Experience:** A timeline of my professional experience and major milestones.
- **Skills:** A list of my technical skills, displayed using icons and badges for a visual touch.
- **Projects:** View some of the projects I've worked on, including links to live sites or GitHub repositories.
- **Contact:** A form to leave a message. Plus, a section to view messages all mesages (once submitted).

The navigation menu is designed to be sticky, meaning it will remain visible at the top of the page as you scroll down. This provides easy access to other sections of the website at any time.

On mobile devices, the site features a mobile navigation menu that is implemented using pure CSS without the use of JavaScript. This ensures a smooth and responsive navigation experience on smaller screens.

### Project Section
The projects section dynamically fetches data from my GitHub account to display my most recent projects. Each project includes a brief description, technologies used, and a link to view more details.

### Leave a Message & Messages Section
Visitors can leave a message through a form provided in the "Leave a Message" section. Submitted messages are displayed in the "Messages" section below. You can also edit or remove your messages.

## Technologies Used

This website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features responsive design principles to ensure it looks great on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers. It has been tested and is compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Safari, including mobile browsers on iOS. This ensures a seamless experience across the most popular web and mobile platforms.

For the icons, I used resources from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
